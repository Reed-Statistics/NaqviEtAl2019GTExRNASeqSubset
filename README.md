The goal of NaqviEtAl2019_GTEx_RNASeq_Subset is to provide a subset (first 50 human samples) of data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). 

GTEx is an open-source database containing whole genome RNA sequencing data from healthy human subjects, in an "ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation" (found at https://gtexportal.org/home/). 

Data used in the 2019 study by Naqvi et al. Dataset being used by Maddy Doak in her 2019-2020 Reed College Senior Thesis. This public package is being created by Christy Lei, Claire Milander-Mashlan, and Maddy Doak for Data Science (Math 241) at Reed College, taught by Dr. Kelly McConville (https://mcconville.rbind.io/).
